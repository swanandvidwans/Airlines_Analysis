# Airlines Data Analysis

- We are using Pyspark for the analysis

- Step 1: We imported modules (pyspark, sql, pandas) and the data. Converted it to PySpark dataframe. We viewed the data.

- Step 2: We selected different substes of data and performed EDA such as: Total number of flights, cancelled flights, delayed & diverted flights.

- Step 3: We analysed year-wise and month-wise data. Cleaned the data and created UDF for further analysis. Such as - Total number of delayed flights (Cancelled, Diverted, Carrier Delayed, Weather Delayed, NAS Delayed, Security Delayed, Airraft delayed)

- Step 4: We joined all the subset dataframes. We finally analysed total number of on-time flights per year and Found out the top 10 Airports from where flights flew on-time.
